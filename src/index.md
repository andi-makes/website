## A little bit about me
I love to design simple, efficient software and hardware.
I enjoy picking electronic parts, drawing a schematic and finally
bringing my ideas to life by designing and producing a PCB.

When it comes to programming my new creations, the language of my choice
is either C, C++ or Rust. While C might be the obvious choice for programming
low level devices like microcontrollers, I see a lot of potential in using some
features that C++ provides, namely namespaces and constant expressions.
Thanks to the compiler, if done correctly, the written C++ code is as efficient
as some equivalent C code, while providing higher levels of abstraction.
While I haven't used Rust extensively for embedded programming, I'd like to
try it out some day. I've played around with it for a little bit, and the tooling
as well as the existing hardware abstraction layers seem very promising.

I'm mostly using Rust to program normal applications. I am convinced that Rust 
will have a bright future alongside other programming languages like C, C++ and Go.
